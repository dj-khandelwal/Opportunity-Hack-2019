Sewa As A Service (SaaS): A platform that allowed NPOs to connect with volunteers and manage the various support requests that
came in via the data pipeline and the workflow management tool. Primarily worked on the fully responsive webpage and system
integration. We used a Python based backend, a MySQLite DB, and a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based webpage. Utilized APIs from
Trello, Telegram, Twilio, Leaflet, and others to plug in the necessary functionalities.
